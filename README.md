# Please note

This version is going to become out of date soon, as I am rewriting the code [over at git.gay](https://git.gay/a/bifm). This version will include Puppeteer support & will support more sites, as well as a bunch of other small improvements. I'm not going to patch any bugs unless they are a major hole in security. I will archive this repo once the rewrite is complete.

# bypass-it-for-me
BIFM bypasses links server-side to both prevent tracking and to make your privacy our top priority.

## installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tacohitbox/bypass-it-for-me
cd bypass-it-for-me 

# install mongodb optionally to cache results
# read more about it @ docs/cache.md
